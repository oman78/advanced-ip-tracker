# advanced-ip-tracker
A Python-based terminal tool for real-time IP Geolocation tracking and data logging.

## 🚀 Purpose
This project was developed as part of my technical exploration into **API Integration** and **System Logic**. It demonstrates how raw data can be fetched from external services and transformed into a structured, user-friendly format.

## 🛠️ Key Features
* **Real-time Tracking:** Integrates with IP-API for accurate geolocation data.
* **Data Persistence:** Automatically logs results into a `.txt` file for future analysis.
* **Interactive UI:** Custom terminal interface with ANSI color coding for better UX.
* **Error Handling:** Robust logic to manage failed requests and invalid inputs.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** `requests`, `json`, `os`, `time`
* **API:** ip-api.com
